Dart is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
Flutter projects can use both platform-specific and cross-platform code.
The latter is written in Dart.

Dart has mixin-based inheritance!
That means although every class has atmost one superclass, a class body 
can be reused in multiple class hierarchies.
This is to aid the lack of multiple inheritances.
